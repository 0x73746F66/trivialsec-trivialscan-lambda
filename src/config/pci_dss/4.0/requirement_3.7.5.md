Key management policies procedures are implemented to include the retirement, replacement, or destruction of keys used to protect stored account data, as deemed necessary when:

- The key has reached the end of its defined cryptoperiod.
- The integrity of the key has been weakened, including when personnel with knowledge of a cleartext key component leaves the company, or the role for which the key component was known.
- The key is suspected of or known to be compromised.
- Retired or replaced keys are not used for encryption operations.
