Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes that include at least the following:

- Coverage for all locations of stored account data.
- Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization. This bullet is a best practice until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes below for details.
- Limiting data storage amount and retention time to that which is required for legal or regulatory, and/or business requirements.
- Specific retention requirements for stored account data that defines length of retention period and includes a documented business justification.
- Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention policy.
- A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.
