PAN is rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored by using any of the following approaches:

- One-way hashes based on strong cryptography of the entire PAN.
- Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN).

If hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN, or different truncation formats of the same PAN, are present in an environment,are in place such that the different versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.

- Index tokens.
- Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures.
