Hardware and software technologies in use are reviewed at least once every 12 months, including at least the following:

- Analysis that the technologies continue to receive security fixes from vendors promptly.
- Analysis that the technologies continue to support (and do not preclude) the entity's PCI DSS compliance.
- Documentation of any industry announcements or trends related to a technology, such as when a vendor has announced \u201cend of life\u201d plans for a technology.
- Documentation of a plan, approved by senior management, to remediate outdated technologies, including those for which vendors have announced \u201cend of life\u201d plans.

**Note**: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
