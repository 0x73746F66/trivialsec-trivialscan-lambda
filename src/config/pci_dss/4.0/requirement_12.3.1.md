Each PCI DSS requirement that provides flexibility for how frequently it is performed (for example, requirements to be performed periodically) is supported by a targeted risk analysis that is documented and includes:

- Identification of the assets being protected.
- Identification of the threat(s) that the requirement is protecting against.
- Identification of factors that contribute to the likelihood and/or impact of a threat being realized.
- Resulting analysis that determines, and includes justification for, how frequently the requirement must be performed to minimize the likelihood of the threat being realized.
- Review of each targeted risk analysis at least once every 12 months to determine whether the results are still valid or if an updated risk analysis is needed.
- Performance of updated risk analyses when needed, as determined by the annual review.

**Note**: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
