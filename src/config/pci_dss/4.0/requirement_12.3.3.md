Cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in use are documented and reviewed at least once every 12 months, including at least the following:

- An up-to-date inventory of all cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in use, including purpose and where used.
- Active monitoring of industry trends regarding continued viability of all cryptographic cipher suites and protocols in use.
- A documented strategy to respond to anticipated changes in cryptographic vulnerabilities.

**Note**: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
