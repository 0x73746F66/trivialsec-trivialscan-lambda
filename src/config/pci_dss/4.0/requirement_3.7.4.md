Key management policies and procedures are implemented for cryptographic key changes for keys that have reached the end of their cryptoperiod, as defined by the associated application vendor or key owner, and based on industry best practices and guidelines, including the following:

- A defined cryptoperiod for each key type in use.
- A process for key changes at the end of the defined cryptoperiod.
