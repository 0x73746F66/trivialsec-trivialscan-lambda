### Create and implement standards for configuration of firewalls and routers

**1.1.1** A formal process for approving and testing all network connections and changes to the firewall and router configurations.
Document procedures and formal process for testing of:

- Network connections, and
- Changes to firewall and router configurations.

For a sample of network connections, interview responsible personnel and examine records to verify that network connections were approved and tested.
Identify a sample of actual changes made to firewall and router configurations, compare to the change records, and interview responsible personnel to verify the changes were approved and tested.

**1.1.2** Current diagram that identifies all connections between the cardholder data environment and other networks, including any wireless networks.
Examine diagram(s) and observe network configurations to verify that a current network diagram exists and that it documents all connections to the cardholder data environment, including any wireless networks.
Interview responsible personnel to verify that the diagram is kept current.

**1.1.3** Current diagram that shows all cardholder data flows across systems and networks.
Examine data flow diagram and interview personnel to verify the diagram:

- Shows all cardholder data flows across systems and networks.
- Is kept current and updated as needed upon changes to the environment.

**1.1.4** Requirements for a firewall at each Internet connection and between any demilitarized zone (DMZ) and the internal network
zone.
Examine the firewall configuration standards and verify that they include requirements for a firewall at each Internet connection and between any DMZ and the internal network zone.
Verify that the current network diagram is consistent with the firewall configuration standards.
Observe network configurations to verify that a firewall is in place at each Internet connection and between any demilitarized zone (DMZ) and the internal network zone, per the documented configuration standards and network diagrams.

**1.1.5** Description of groups, roles, and responsibilities for management of network components.
Verify that firewall and router configuration standards include a description of groups, roles, and responsibilities for management of network components.
Interview personnel responsible for management of network components to confirm that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented.

**1.1.6** Documentation of business justification and approval for use of all services, protocols, and ports allowed, including documentation of security features implemented for those protocols considered to be insecure.
Verify that firewall and router configuration standards include a documented list of all services, protocols and ports, including business justification and approval for each. Identify insecure services, protocols, and ports allowed; and verify.
Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that the documented security features are implemented for each insecure service, protocol, and port.

**1.1.7** Requirement to review firewall and router rule sets at least every six months. Verify that firewall and router configuration standards require review of firewall and router rule sets at least every six months. Examine documentation relating to rule set reviews and interview responsible personnel to verify that the rule sets are reviewed at least every six months.
