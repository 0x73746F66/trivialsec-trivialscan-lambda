### Create configuration standards for all components of the system

Develop configuration standards for all system components. Assure that these standards address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards as defined, for example, by SysAdmin Audit Network Security Network (SANS), National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST), and Center for Internet Security (CIS).

**2.2.1** Implement only one primary function per server (for example, web servers, database servers, and DNS should be implemented on separate servers)

**2.2.2** Disable all unnecessary and insecure services and protocols (services and protocols not directly needed to perform the devicesâ€™ specified function)

**2.2.3** Security parameters set to prevent misuse

**2.2.4** Remove all unnecessary functionality, such as scripts, drivers, features, subsystems, file systems, and unnecessary web servers.
