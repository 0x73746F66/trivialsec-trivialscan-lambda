### Secure all individual administrative access to the CDE and all remote access to the CDE using multi-factor authentication

Implement two-factor authentication for remote access to the network by employees, administrators, and third parties. Use technologies such as remote authentication and dial-in service (RADIUS) or terminal access controller access control system (TACACS) with tokens, or VPN (based on SSL/TLS or IPSEC) with individual certificates.
